<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio site.
  It's a pleasure for me to be able to share with you some of my work and passions.
  I am a passionate programmer and technologist who is always seeking further understanding in the field of software development and computers.
  I am forever grateful for the mentors who have helped guide and shape my journey as a developer.
  The seeds that you have sown into my future are timeless and I hope to return the favor to others along my way.
  Aside from programming and computers I also enjoy photography, traveling and the experience of meeting others from different cultures and backgrounds that differ from my own.
  I have a deep appreciation for the insight a new perspective can provide. I love music and enjoy playing guitar. I enjoy spending time with my family and my girlfriend of
  who have encouraged me through so much throughout the process of pursuing my passions. I would not be the man I am today without my faith and my God in whom I abide.
